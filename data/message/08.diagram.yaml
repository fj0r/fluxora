          ## Flow Description:
          - User Input: A user types a message into the input field on the UI.
          - Bind to 'chat' event: The UI binds the message to a 'chat' event on the WebSocket (WS).
          - Send to Gateway (GW): The UI sends the message via the WS to the GW.
          - GW Receives Message: The GW, acting purely as a message router, receives the incoming message.
          - Place in 'outgo' queue: The GW places the message into a Kafka queue named 'outgo' for processing by backend services.
          - Business Service Listens: A backend business service continuously listens to the 'outgo' queue.
          - Detects 'chat' event: The business service retrieves the message and identifies it as a 'chat' event.
          - Call AI: The business service processes the message and sends it to the AI for a response.
          - AI Generates Response: The AI processes the request and generates a response.
          - Place in 'income' queue: The business service places the AI's response into another Kafka queue named 'income'.
          - GW Listens to 'income': The GW also listens to the 'income' queue for outgoing messages.
          - GW Receives with Recipient Info: The GW retrieves the AI's response, which includes information about the intended recipient on its "envelope".
          - Forward to WS: The GW uses the recipient information to send the message to the corresponding WS connection.
          - WS Receives Message: The WS receives the message from the GW.
          - UI Renders Content: The UI receives the message from the WS and renders the new chat content.
